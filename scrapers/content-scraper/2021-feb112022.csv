How to Keep One's Self Pure in this World,"Coptic Orthodox Answers, 01 Apr 21",,4/1/21,Fr Gabriel Wissa,,,"It is generally no easy task to be a Christian in this world. And, in this last decade, it has become increasingly more difficult. Humanity has been giving in to oblivious ideas and the morality level is rapidly declining causing many to stumble and giving in to their passions. As Christians, we are not surprised, Scripture does warn us of this eventuality. Matthew 24 says: “…because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.” But the question becomes how do we, as Christians, deal with this? Of course, we can always consider physically renouncing the world and detaching from it. But the reality is we are not monks or nuns or missionaries in unaffected areas. In fact, we have to deal with the world and its darkness on a daily basis. So, how to keep one’s self pure in this sinful world?",yes,5d0fdfb1-c63a-4bc1-b89c-3cc28495b142
